<h1><b>THEMOODBOARD WEB APP</b></h1>

Designed and developed a moodboard builder.<br>
This is a moodboard app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to visually organize notes, images and text. 

What is a Moodboard?<br>
💡 A moodboard is a visual space to collect and organize ideas using images, text, and notes.
It's used by designers and creatives to plan styles, concepts, or inspiration.<br>

🚀 Functionalities of My Web App
---

✅ **1. Add Elements to the Board**  
Users can add notes, images, and text blocks to the main workspace by clicking buttons. Each element appears as a draggable box on the board.

✅ **2. Drag and Position Items Freely**  
All elements (notes, images, text, etc.) can be dragged and moved anywhere on the board. This gives users full control over how they organize their ideas visually.

✅ **3. Paste Images from Clipboard**  
Users can copy and paste images (or image URLs) directly into the workspace. The pasted image appears on the board and can also be moved around like any other item.

✅ **4. Download Workspace as PNG**  
You can now download your entire moodboard workspace as a PNG image. Just click the download button, and a snapshot of your board will be saved, perfect for sharing or saving your creative layout.
